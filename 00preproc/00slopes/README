program parflowslopes 
written by Michael Barnes 
April 2012

This program is free software provided under the terms of the GPL  

This program creates slope input files for ParFlow using three ascii text raster data files exported from GRASS; a DEM, a flow direction grid, and a river file. 

A Makefile is included.  It will work as is with a recent version of gfortran and gnu make, otherwise, editing the compiler flags may be necessary.

To build:
$> make

To clean up:
$> make clean

To use:
1)Use grass_create_location.sh to create a new location for your analysis based on a georeferenced DEM.

$>grass_create_location.sh gisfile $(path to the dem) $(name for location)

2)Edit the parameters in GRASS_slopes.sh.
  Calculate basin area for rivers in terms of number of cells(THRESHOLD)
  Decide on minimum slope threshold(MINSLO)
  Calculate an average slope for your drainage network(RIVSLO)
  Edit nz and dz to match your model

3)Run GRASS_batch_setup.sh to setup and run GRASS_slopes.sh and parflowslopes

$>GRASS_batch_setup.sh
